# C++ Learning Templates
This repository contains two learning programs in C++ that guide through essential concepts for video game development and mastering algorithms.

## Available Programs

1. [**Video game oriented C++ program**](programme_cpp_jeu_video.md)
   - This 3-week program is designed to teach how to use C++ in the context of video game development. Each day, a practical exercise that help develop skills, starting from the basics to creating simple games.

2. [**Algorithm program in C++**](program_algorithms_cpp.md)
   - This 3-week program focuses on learning fundamental and advanced algorithms in C++. There find daily exercises to strengthen problem solving and code optimization skills.

## How to Use These Programs
